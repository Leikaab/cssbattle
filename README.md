# Different solutions for cssbattle

decided to try cssbattle for fun, im mostly a backend dev/ architect, so my css skills are pretty mediocre,
and the quality loss is pretty high if I don't use it for a while. cssbattle seemed like a good way to have some fun with css and get some practice at the same time.

I'm not trying to get the lowest amount of chars since that leeds to a hacky approch.
